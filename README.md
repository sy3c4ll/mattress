_TODO_

### Usage

See [src/demo.c](https://github.com/sy3c4ll/mattress/blob/master/src/demo.c)

### Compiling

Run `make` to build the example. Integrate the two files `mattress.h`, `mattress.cpp` into your project to use it yourself, and compile as you would any other source file.

Prerequisites: GNU Make (`make`), GNU GCC (`g++`)
